# BankNote-Net: Open Dataset for Assistive Currency Recognition

Millions of people around the world have low or no vision. Assistive software applications have been developed for a variety of day-to-day tasks, including currency recognition. To aid with this task, we present BankNote-Net, an open dataset for assistive currency recognition. 
The dataset consists of a total of **24,816 embeddings** of banknote images captured in a variety of assistive scenarios, spanning **17 currencies** and **112 denominations**. These compliant embeddings were learned using supervised contrastive learning and a MobileNetV2 architecture, and they can be used to train and test specialized downstream models for any currency, including those not covered by our dataset or for which only a few real images per denomination are available (few-shot learning). We deploy a variation of this model for public use in the last version of the [Seeing AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/seeing-ai) app developed by Microsoft, which has over a 100 thousand monthly active users.

If you make use of this dataset or pre-trained model in your own project, **please consider referencing this GitHub repository and citing our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03738.pdf)**:

## Data Structure

The dataset data structure consists of 256-dimensional vector embeddings with additional columns for currency, denomination and face labels, as explained in the [data exploration](./src/data_exploration.ipynb) notebook. 
The dataset is saved as **24,826 x 258** flat table in [feather](./data/banknote_net.feather) and [csv](./data/banknote_net.csv) file formats. Figure 1 presents some of these learned embeddings.

## Setup and Dataset Usage

1. **Install** requirements.
    
    Please, use the conda environment file [env.yaml](./env.yaml) to install the right dependencies.

     ```
     # Create conda environment
     conda env create -f env.yaml

     # Activate environment to run examples
     conda activate banknote_net
     ```


2. **Example 1**: Train a shallow classifier directly from the dataset embeddings for a currency available in the dataset. For inference, images should be encoded first using the keras MobileNet V2 pre-trained [encoder model](./models/banknote_net_encoder.h5).

    Run the following file from root: [train_from_embedding.py](./src/train_from_embedding.py)
    
      ```
      python src/train_from_embedding.py --currency AUD --bsize 128 --epochs 25 --dpath ./data/banknote_net.feather
      ```
    
      ```
        usage: train_from_embedding.py [-h] --currency
                                    {AUD,BRL,CAD,EUR,GBP,INR,JPY,MXN,PKR,SGD,TRY,USD,NZD,NNR,MYR,IDR,PHP}
                                    [--bsize BSIZE] [--epochs EPOCHS]
                                    [--dpath DPATH]

        Train model from embeddings.

        optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --currency {AUD,BRL,CAD,EUR,GBP,INR,JPY,MXN,PKR,SGD,TRY,USD,NZD,NNR,MYR,IDR,PHP}, --c {AUD,BRL,CAD,EUR,GBP,INR,JPY,MXN,PKR,SGD,TRY,USD,NZD,NNR,MYR,IDR,PHP}
                                String of currency for which to train shallow
                                classifier
        --bsize BSIZE, --b BSIZE
                                Batch size for shallow classifier
        --epochs EPOCHS, --e EPOCHS
                                Number of epochs for training shallow top classifier
        --dpath DPATH, --d DPATH
                                Path to .feather BankNote Net embeddings
                            
      ```

3. **Example 2**: Train a classifier on top of the BankNote-Net pre-trained [encoder model](./models/banknote_net_encoder.h5) using images in a custom directory. Input images must be of size 224 x 224 pixels and have square aspect ratio. For this example, we use a couple dozen images spanning 8 classes for Swedish Krona, structured as in the [example_images/SEK](./data/example_images/SEK) directory, that contains both training and validation images.

    Run the following file from root: [train_custom.py](./src/train_custom.py)
    
      ```
      python src/train_custom.py --bsize 4 --epochs 25 --data_path ./data/example_images/SEK/ --enc_path ./models/banknote_net_encoder.h5
      ```
    
      ```
    usage: train_custom.py [-h] [--bsize BSIZE] [--epochs EPOCHS]
                        [--data_path DATA_PATH] [--enc_path ENC_PATH]

    Train model from custom image folder using pre-trained BankNote-Net encoder.

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit

    --data_path DATA_PATH, --data DATA_PATH
                            Path to folder with images.
    --enc_path ENC_PATH, --enc ENC_PATH
                            Path to .h5 file of pre-trained encoder model.                       
      ```

4. **Example 3**: Perform inference using the SEK few-shot classifier of Example 2, and the validation images on [example_images/SEK/val](./data/example_images/SEK/val)

    Run the following file from root: [predict_custom.py](./src/predict_custom.py), returns encoded predictions.
    
      ```
        python src/predict_custom.py --bsize 1 --data_path ./data/example_images/SEK/val/ --model_path ./src/trained_models/custom_classifier.h5
